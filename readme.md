# Steps to run Web Api and React

### Clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:EdilsonAndrade/weather.git
```

### After clone, a folder with name weather must exist into your current path

- Enter into each folder (split terminal to be easier)
- in the folder weather_api run the following command

```
dotnet run
```

### Important, verify which port itÂ´s running

You can do a test getting the url showed in the previous command
and adding /swagger i.e

```
http://localhost:5014/swagger
```

in swagger you can click on `try it out` and paste in the required field a valid USA address like `3490 Canvas Street Kissimmee FL`

You should see a result
